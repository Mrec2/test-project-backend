# QuizMatrix Backend

## Overview
In our endeavor to develop QuizMatrix, we are leveraging a variety of technologies to propel the Backend towards excellence. On the Backend, we are exploring different iterations. The initial version follows the conventional approach using Servlets, while another implements the MVC design pattern with DAO or Hibernate for database interaction. The final version is taking shape with Spring Boot, aiming for a robust and efficient solution.

This entire process is designed to equip us with the skills and knowledge necessary to seamlessly adapt to various work environments utilizing Java as the technological foundation.

This exciting project is the result of collaboration among several peers from the Java/Spring Web Applications course at Core Network. Together, we are charting a path towards excellence in Java application development.
